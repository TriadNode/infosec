facts
1. can use aws resources for 1yr. maybe. looks more like "30 days for the good stuff, then we charge you".  
1(ammended). can create private cloud with VPN protocols.  ask ------- about s3 bucket compute prices before ruling AWS out.
2. can tunnel syslog over internet using stunnel for tls/ssl.  
3. want experience with AWS, SIEM, Splunk, and an excuse to practice regex.

so I can set up OSSIM anywhere, but need to feed it data.  
so I can set up Splunk anywhere, but need to feed it data.  
so I can integrate Splunk and OSSIM together, but only if on the same (SplOSSIM) Box.  
so I can generate data from machines at home.  
so I can generate data from an AWS honeypot.  
so I can use AWS to host SplOSSIM, but would need to tunnel logs to AWS from home.

assets/liabilities
assets
 AWS to host SplOSSIM
  would ship syslog OUT of home LAN, and block all incoming
  opportunity to refine and use to build a CAN
 AWS to host AWS honeypot
  would generate real world threat hunting data
liabilities
  AWS to host SplOSSIM
    might be some threat vectors I haven't thought about (think PRTG netmon CVE)
  AWS to host AWS honeypot
    would ship encrypted syslog INTO the home LAN, is a threat vector
    
so if AWS honeypot syslog --> home LAN == threat
and AWS SplOSSIM <-- home LAN syslog == !threat
perhaps AWS honeypot and AWS SplOSSIM can coexist through virtual routing & switching.
this would look like: 
  [AWS[OSSIM[Splunk]][honeypot]]<===stunnel===[home LAN]

OSSIM install guide
don't need a guide

Splunk install
don't need a guide

Splunk integrate with OSSIM
google it, use the plugin
