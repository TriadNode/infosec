CEH v10 has a passing score that ranges from 60%-85% depending on which questions you get from the question bank. 
Questions are weighted differently.
STAY AWAY FROM QUIZLET! Quizlet's incorrect answer factor was way too high to deal with. 


Resources in order of usefulness:

  Almost exactly like the real exam word-for-word.
  Some answers are incorrect. Maybe 5%. Fact check!

  Reading recent experience and advice proved invaluable.
  Some users have posted references that rabbit-hole into even better resources. Worth exploring post by post.
