Prerequisites
	A machine dedicated to running the VPN (just a PC in your lab)
	Static IP for the server (mind your dhcp pool range)
	Your chosen port forwarded for the VPN to work (I have a garbage soho router, but it still lets me port forward. I used port 		443 since it's not usually blocked on things like corporate networks)
	Static external IP or dynamic DNS (I use ChangeIP for mine since it's free)
		If you use noip then you can more easily set up dynamic dns in netgear routers and thus likely other soho routers
	

Installing OpenVPN Server
	Download from the official site (You will want the Windows installer)
	Install OpenVPN and make sure to check the "EasyRSA" box
	Click "Install" when prompted to install the TAP driver

Creating The CA Certificate
	Open CMD as admin and paste these commands in
	  cd "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa"
	  init-config.bat
	  notepad C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\vars.bat
	When notepad opens, change the following:
	  set DH_KEY_SIZE=2048 --> set DH_KEY_SIZE=1024
	  set KEY_SIZE=4096 --> set KEY_SIZE=1024
	You can also change the certificate fields. These don't matter too much, so you can put whatever you want in them. I chose to 		put my DDNS in mine for example:
	  set KEY_COUNTRY=US --> GB
	  set KEY_PROVINCE=CA --> GB
	  set KEY_CITY=SanFrancisco --> GB
	  set KEY_ORG=OpenVPN --> sample.ddns.us
	  set KEY_EMAIL=mail@host.domain --> sample.ddns.us@mail.com
	  set KEY_CN=changeme --> sample.ddns.us
	  set KEY_NAME=changeme --> sample.ddns.us
	  set KEY_OU=changeme --> sample.ddns.us
	  set PKCS11_MODULE_PATH=changeme --> sample.ddns.us
	  set PKCS11_PIN=1234 (keep as the same)
	Save and close the notepad file
	Next, run these commands:
	  cd "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa"
	  vars.bat
	  clean-all.bat
	  build-ca.bat
	Press enter through "build-ca.bat" apart from these fields. Enter "ca" without the quotation marks for these
	  Common name: ca
	  Name: ca
Building The Server Certificate
	Next we want to build the server key. Run the below command
	  build-key-server.bat server
	Like above, set the "common name" and "name" for this as "server"
	  Common name: server
	  Name: server
	Press enter through the rest and enter "y" for signing and committing the cert
Building Client Certificate(s)
	Next we need to make a certificate for each client. In my case my only client is my android phone, so I just made the one and 		called it "Client". You can replace this with a friendly name if you want
	  vars.bat
	  build-key.bat your-device-name-here
	Again, set the "common name" and "name" for this as your client's name
	  Common name: your-device-name-here
	  Name: your-device-name-here
	Press enter through the rest and enter "y" for signing and committing the cert
Building DH Parameters
	In the CMD window, run
	  build-dh.bat
	This will generate "dh1024.pem" in the config folder
Building TLS Key
	Run these commands to generate ta.key (More info about this can be found here)
	  cd "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin"
	  openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
	  move "ta.key" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
Moving Server Files To Config Folder
	Run the below commands to move the files you generated for the server to the config folder for it to run
	  cd "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys"
	  move "ca.crt" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
	  move "dh1024.pem" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
	  move "server.crt" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
	  move "server.key" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
Creating .OVPN Files
	Run these commands to prep your client and server .ovpn files
	  md "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\clients"
	  cd "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\sample-config"
	  copy "server.ovpn" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config"
	  copy "client.ovpn" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\clients"
  
Modifying Server.ovpn
	Before going forward I'd strongly recommend installing Notepad++, purely because it makes all the next steps much easier
	Run this command to open "server.ovpn" in notepad++
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\server.ovpn"
	Replace all the text in "server.ovpn" with this config file at https://pastebin.com/raw/08BYUYPR
	If you want to run OpenVPN on a different port, make sure to forward that port on your router and modify it in the "server.ovpn" 	file
	Modifying your-device-name-here.ovpn
	Run these commands to open up all of your certs and keys in Notepad++
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\clients\client.ovpn"
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\ca.crt"
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys\client.crt"
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\easy-rsa\keys\client.key"
	  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe" "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\ta.key"
	Replace all the text in the "your-device-name-here.ovpn" with the text from this config here https://pastebin.com/raw/ymh2LbQJ
	Replace "example.ddns.us 443" with whatever your DDNS address or static IP is and the port you're using
	Now go through each crt and key file, replacing "X here" with the keys (This is so that the data from the files is in the 1 		.ovpn file. This is better for cross device compatibility)
	Save "your-device-name-here.ovpn"
	You can now copy "your-device-name-here.ovpn" to whatever device you're using. I copied mine to my Android phone using Google 		Drive (If you're using Android, install the OpenVPN Connect app)

Configuring The Server To Allow Traffic
	This next part makes it so that your VPN sends all traffic through it
	Open "regedit" and paste this text into the top address bar
	  Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
	Double click "IPEnabledRouter" and enter the value data as "1"
	Now open "run" and enter "services.msc"
	Find "Routing and Remote Access", right click it, go into properties and change the "Startup type" to "Automatic"
	Now find "OpenVPNService", right click it, go into properties and change the "Startup type" to "Automatic"
	Now go into Control Panel and navigate to "Network and Sharing Center" then click "Change Adapter Settings" on the left
	Find the adapter that has "TAP" underneath it, then rename that adapter to "TAP"
	Right click on your adapter that has an internet connection and go to "properties"
	Select "Sharing" at the top and check the box for "Allow other network users to connect..."
	You may have a drop down box to select what networks can run through it (this usually shows up if you've got Hyper-V or 		something like that running on it). If that shows up, click the drop down box and select "TAP"
	I had no TAP option and tried Local Area Connection 2, word is out on if this works, i'll report back
	
Set up your connecting client
	Transfer the *.ovpn file to your client pc
	Install either OpenVPN or OpenVPN Client on the client pc
	Start whichever OpenVPN program, right click its icon in system tray, import the *.ovpn file
	You can now start trying to connect.  I installed both programs, will report back on which one works best for Windows
