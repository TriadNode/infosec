don't accidentally provision a new server over your vulnerable ubuntu vm
if you do, learn how to seed a build

-pn scans through a web proxy will always show port open.  always add --reason to the end

default 'port scan detected' threshold is like 30ms.  add --scan-delay <number>s to go below threshold

consider ping scan, then single port scan, then creating a smal list of likely IP addresses and doing a scan-delay fast scan

look through seclists for small passwordlists, add to it, then create permutations

keep scans and information gathering nicely structured within folders and easily named files.  

three rounds of shikatanagai is not enough obfuscation to bypass.  try 15-20???
experiment with known-good executables as trojans.  if that doesn't simplify then try obfuscate prior to trojan re-packaging

no *.exe will get through any normal email filter, but zip files will.  
chrome may still block upon download and burn your file share account.  
if zip file is large enough, then chrome will not scan download.  what is the threshold???

need a better way to get into network.  jump over firewall completely, then tunnel outward.  

need a wan-accessible gateway for receiving shells.  

might be possible to crack cobalt strike then use teamserver.
pupy is something to try as well.
