What:
Network Intrusion Detection System
Impression:
Painful to set up, but not as painful as one would think.  
The most painful part perhaps is integrating Snort into some stack for graphical output.  
Snort is pretty fast.  Lots of templates out there for rule writing.  
There are a lot of white papers out there on streamlining a snort build, and false positive rules to disable.  
In Snort vs Suricata, Snort integrates more readily with threat exchanges and snorby outputs.  
In Snort vs Suricata, Snort is NIDS only, while Suricata can be configured as a NIPS.  
Result:
In production use.
