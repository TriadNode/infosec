What: 
Directory as a service, SSO integration for a lot of Saas apps
Impression: 
using their AD on testbed broke the other local user profile.  
modules which provide like-a-GPO-management are limited to only a few controls.  
the AD like-a-GPO-management is pretty thin, it's not NEAR as granular as actual AD.  
therefore it's not as much of an AD replacement as one would hope, but it does provide 
basic domain profile management, which I imagine is valuable to most businesses.  
However the SSO is pretty awesome.  Hello G Suite integration.  
Some of our more obscure Saas are not available in jumpcloud's sso.  
Key take away for me is that Daas AD profile broke local account, and if not able to 
import local account profile to Daas AD account then it's a no-go for our users.  
Result: 
back burner while investigating RMM.  if we have to pay for something, then getting 
more for the same price is better.  Jumpcloud is $10per, fwiw.
