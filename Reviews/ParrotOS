What: 
linux distro pentesting oriented
Impressions: 
debian based, lightweight, has anonsurf already included, along with some other stuff that's not inherent in kali.  
it's pretty slick, i like it.  32-bit is no longer supported, so the pitch that it's lightweight enough to be used 
on lower power machines is kind of moot.  won't install on my netbook, for instance, where kali will in 32-bit 
supported form.  but overall this is just another debian distro, nothing special.  
Result: 
suitable for personal daily driver where kali is not
