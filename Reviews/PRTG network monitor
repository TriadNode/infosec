What: 
network monitor
Impressions: 
really customizable, all features are present and work, has network discovery, has SNMP walking discovery, 
has custom dashboards more granular than Pandora FMS, has better logging, has better everything.  
100 sensors are free, 3 sensors are dedicated to host server, & multiple graphs can be made from each 
sensor if you are smart about where you pull them from.  graphs can be made super easy to understand, which is great 
for upper management.  is a little hard on windows host but can be tweaked to have less system impact.  
beware, there are CVEs for it, keep dashboard inside the network.  
Result: 
in production
