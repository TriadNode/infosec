What:
Localized Domain or Workgroup Administration w/Azure integration
Impression: 
Slick, this gives me everything that I had just set up through powershell WinRm, but in gui form.  
Can perform a lot of basic remote mgmt such as add/remove, Enter-PSSession, control processes, 
rename computer, view system info, etc.  Just install Windows Admin Center, it's free, run it on 
your workstation, enroll clients computers.  
Client computers must be on a private network, their conenction type must be set to private.  
Client computers must be in the same workgroup.  Client computers must connect by computer name.  
I think client computers must have WinRM enabled first before they can be enrolled, but I'm not sure.  
I had just already enrolled them and added the trustedhost before trying WAC.  
Result:
In production.
