What:
Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
Impression:
Not any easier to set up than Snort.  In fact, it is a little harder due to the fact that 
you can't just feed it all Snort rules and expect them all to work properly.  
In Suricata vs Snort, Suricata can be configured to fork an alert into other processes 
such as remedial actions via custom scripts, where Snort cannot.  
Result:
In production use
