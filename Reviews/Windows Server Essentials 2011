What: 
windows server essentials 2011
Impression: 
this is really Windows Server 2008 R2 Lite.  
stood up AD, DC, DNS, all GPOs, security profiles, computers, users, hardened the server, enrolled and did testing.  
what an absolute pain.  very powerful.  most of the stuff that makes AD great also costs more money.  RDP server and SCCM 
licensing costs extra, as does promoting every single workstation to Pro or Enterprise.  Must also build a new DC with 
licensing at each remote branch to enroll them, yeah they have to be separate forests.  this is all very costly.  
most of the benefit of AD is ease of workstation management via GPO.  allows restrictions on desktop environment, granular 
user profile control, granular software control.  
Result: 
Not placing into production due to associated costs and danger to company if they are without an IT guy for a long time.  
have also found that most of the benefits of AD management can be gained through other, WAY less costly means.
