What: 
Saas app suite
Impressions: 
more slick than outlook.  more requested by younger users.  
offers secondary methods of performing office work through sheets/docs, offers possibility to use forms, 
offers a much better method of log review and identity management than saas provided exchange.  offers 
much more granular email security control than saas provided exchange.  offers ability to leverage team drives 
and automatically import local documentss to said team drives via google file stream.  search function in the 
google gmail and drive apps also push users to be more open to using search funnction in win10, which is a blessing.  
it's also helping push users to use chrome instead of IE.  i get the feeling that i can somehow leverage g suite 
and other saas to provide something greater than the sum of each part.  thinking of solutions such as jumpcloud, 
the free apps within google app ecosystem, or pushing chrome extensions through chocolatey to pair with the browser 
ecosystem that g suite pushes the users into.  cost for g suite business is now i think $13/per.  
Result: 
migrated all users from exchange to g suite business.
