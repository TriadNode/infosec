What:
Elastic Stack = ElasticSearch indexer, Logstash log forwarder, Kibana graphing dashboard.
Impression:
I had set this up to parse and view snort logs on a test machine.  
Test machine was low resource machine, elasticsearch in particular absolutely thrashed the CPU's cyclic rate.  
Was difficult to get the hang of pointing all three pieces of stack toward another, initially.  
The trick is to have E output to L output to K.  Just find the config or yaml for each and set the paths.  
Heard that LAMP is similar, just more specifically for webserver.  
I was able to get feed in multiple log sources, all the way up to the kibana dashboard.  
However, I was trying to use a template for the kibana dashboard and only got 60% of the dashboard linking properly.  
At that point I ate up my testing time and had to move on to another method for the whole NIDS, given Elasticsearch's 
resource intensiveness.
So overall, it looks like the ELK stack should be on a modern machine and from what I was able to feed into 
it, ELK stack is very very very useful for funneling various types of logs into one format and dash.  
Result:
Abandoned and moved on to try smoothsec build.
