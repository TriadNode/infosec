What:
Lightweight Ubuntu OS
Impressions:
Purpose of testing was to contrast against CentOS Minimal as possible host for various *nux server builds.
Was hoping that it would be light enough to provide a friendlier admin experience for future non-Linux 
IT Admins, and also be light enough to host production services when installed on retired machines.  
It is lighter than Ubuntu vanilla, but not near as light as minimal installs of other Linux distros.  
Is about on par with any xfce4 equipped distro.  I don't think that the stock desktop environment is 
"enough like windows" to really replace stripped down win10 machines for future admins who don't know 
anything about linux.  
Result:
Abandoned, just stick with minimal installs, or use a regular distro with xfce4 DE.
