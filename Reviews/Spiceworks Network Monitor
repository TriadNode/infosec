What: 
network monitor, free for a few sensors
Impressions: 
looks nice to CEO but not very useful on my side of things.  no customization of dashboard.  
SNMPv3 support not working & device discovery is done with a totally disconnected module, must then import all by hand.
Result:
abandoned in search of better netmon.  spiceworks is still calling.
