Audit Policies
Windows Server 2008 has detailed audit facilities that allow administrators to tune their audit policy with greater specificity. By enabling the legacy audit facilities outlined in this section, it is probable that the performance of the system may be reduced and that the security event log will realize high event volumes. Given this, it is recommended that Detailed Audit Policies in the subsequent section be leveraged in favor over the policies represented below. Additionally, the "Force audit policy subcategory settings", which is recommended to be enabled, causes Windows to favor the audit subcategories over the legacy audit policies. For the above reasons, this Benchmark does not prescribe specific values for legacy audit policies.

Detailed Security Auditing
This section articulates the detailed audit policies introduced in Windows Vista and later. Prior to Windows Server 2008 R2, these settings could only be established via the auditpol.exe utility. However, in Server 2008 R2, GPOs exist for managing these items. Guidance is provided for establishing the recommended state using via GPO and auditpol.exe. The values prescribed in this section represent the minimum recommended level of auditing.
