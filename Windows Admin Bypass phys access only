bypass admin password by blanking it out, only works with hands on access
I do this all the time at work, it works well but is not sneaky

note: use kali live usb, stick it in that machine already
1. shift+restart to enter recovery mode
2. advanced>boot to UEFI>do it
pc now boots to bios
3. remove secureboot and fastboot, change boot priority to USB first
4. save/exit
now boots to kali live
5. select live forensic mode
6. file manager>windows>windows>system32>config, open terminal here
now terminal is open
7. chntpw -l SAM
lists users and type on machine
8. chntpw -u <username> SAM
9. press 1, press y
password has been cleared, you can now log in with blank password
10. reboot -h now
remove thumb drive and log in
