Notes: 
Using a bridge makes things easier on everyone
Send syslog to syslog server of course
Set up interfaces as below, bonis points if you have a 4th interface
  Create LACP1  # to mirror Br1 traffic to Fa3
  Create BridgedInterface1  # to make Fa1 and Fa2 transparent
  Create FastEthernet1  # firewall interface
  Create FastEthernet2  # firewall interface
  Create FastEthernet3  # management interface
  Create IN_Ruleset  # firewall ruleset
  Create OUT_Ruleset  # firewall ruleset

  Configure BridgedInterface1  # this is where Fa1 and Fa2 go
    Assign no IP Address  # no IP, transparent FW plz
    Assign IN_Ruleset
    Assign OUT_Ruleset
    Assign to LACP1  # (only if you have 4th interface)

  Configure FastEthernet1  # I connect to edge router
    Assign no IP Address
    Assign to BridgedInterface1

  Configure FastEthernet2  # I connect to internal subnet router
    Assign no IP Address
    Assign to BridgedInterface1

  Configure FastEthernet3  # I connect to internal switchstack
    Assign IP Address  # this is your new mgmt ip
  
  Configure FastEthernet4
    Assign IP Address  # this is your new NIDS agent, hope you have Gi
    Assign to LACP1  # send this to NIDS
