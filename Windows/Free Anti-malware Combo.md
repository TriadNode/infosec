Best free combo so far for Host protection: 

1. Windows Defender
    Windows Defender provides free SIGNATURE based malware detection.  

2. Malwarebytes Free
    Malwarebytes Free provides free BEHAVIOR based malware detection.

3. Kaspersky Anti-Ransomware for Business Free
    Kaspersky Anti-Ransomware provides free SIGNATURE AND BEHAVIOR based ransomware detection.
    
All three can coexist with each other on any windows platform.  

For small businesses who cannot afford licensing to protect all endpoints, this provides the best 
coverage so far with free solutions.  I've been noticing a lot of MSPs dropping clients for not 
wanting to invest enough into their IT budget, keeping this list handy might help someone at a 
later date.
