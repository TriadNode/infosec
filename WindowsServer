Process so far

Double check network firewall rules before plugging an un-hardened microsoft server into the network
DHCP should be allocated for the server before install
This server should be behind the main network's firewall, and behind its own dedicated network firewall.
Again, server should be behind its own dedicated network firewall.
WAN<>FW1<>LAN1<>FW2<>LAN2
Server goes in LAN2

Install from disk
enter product key
blah blah blah, until you are at the desktop.  

enter Business Name, Server (box) Name, internal Domain (add "-DC" if is a DC).  
create admin name and pass (better not name it admin) and user name and pass (better name it admin)
activate product key NOW
disable windows firewall for now (you checked the network firewall rules...RIGHT???)
set up automatic backup
add roles and features: RDP package
check for updates/install updates
Recheck updates, install & restart.  Do this a few times until you catch all update rollouts.  
WinSvr is now installed and updated.
Allow RDP from admin machine on firewall and turn firewall back on. 

add roles and features: bitlocker, ps ISE
scan server with nmap
  my god look at all those open services.  
run Security Configuration Wizard according to server's PRIMARY role
scan server again with nmap
  research each unopen port to see if it can be closed w/out messing with AD services, close what you can.
  at this point, it should be blocking all ping probes completely, forcing you to use -Pn

add roles and features: AD DS
Promote to DC
Add new OU's for workstations: 
  OU Name:"DomainComputers"
    OU Name:<City>
      OU Name:<Department>
        OU Name:<DepartmentSubSection>
Add new OU's for user roles: 
  OU Name:"DomainUsers"
    OU Name:<City>
      OU Name:<Department>
        OU Name:<PositionTitle>

Go through all the GPO settings found at GPO.md
  note: this step is really horrible, but some of these settings are very client-specific

TODO:
install AV
install zonealarm
install tripwire
re-run security configuration wizard
install MBSA and SCCM
go through all three server hardening lists, post steps here for future conformity 
set up granular GPOs & business objects
