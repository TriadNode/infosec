Process so far

Double check network firewall rules before plugging an un-hardened microsoft server into the network
DHCP should be allocated for the server before install
This server should be behind the main network's firewall, and behind its own dedicated network firewall.
Again, server should be behind its own dedicated network firewall.
WAN<>FW1<>LAN1<>FW2<>LAN2
Server goes in LAN2

Install from disk
enter product key
blah blah blah, until you are at the desktop.  

enter Business Name, Server (box) Name, internal Domain (add "-DC" if is a DC).  
create admin name and pass (better not name it admin) and user name and pass (better name it admin)
activate product key NOW
disable windows firewall for now (you checked the network firewall rules...RIGHT???)
set up automatic backup
add roles and features: RDP package
check for updates/install updates
Recheck updates, install & restart.  Do this a few times until you catch all update rollouts.  Takes a while.
Windows Server is now installed and updated.
Allow RDP from admin machine on firewall and turn firewall back on. 

add roles and features: bitlocker, ps ISE
scan server with nmap
  my god look at all those open services.  
run Security Configuration Wizard according to server's PRIMARY role
scan server again with nmap
  research each unopen port to see if it can be closed w/out messing with AD services, close what you can.
  at this point, it should be blocking all ping probes completely, forcing you to use -Pn
add roles and features: AD DS
Promote to DC
Disable default Administrator account and change description to look like guest
Change fake Admin account description to look like admin
Change actual Admin account description to look like guest
Initially harden Domain Controller GPO according to https://security.uconn.edu/server-hardening-standard-windows/#

Create OU's per Domain, Site, and Department
Create a Group in each Department
Create a Computer in each Department for each existing computer
Note: GPO's are applied in a computer-then-user order, use this for troubleshooting.  
Create a GPO for Domain with baseline security and hand-holding settings
Create a GPO for each Department with role-based security and hand-holding settings
Add each Computer to Group
Add each child Group to Parent Group all the way up to forest root.

SCCM install for remote mgmt
  pre-requisites
    client must be able to resolve FQDN of DC
      find it under Start>DNS>ForwardLookupZones>properties of literally any of the entries will give DC's FQDN
      edit client host files may be needed to import this entry
    open 80&443(mgmt)
    open 8530&8531(SoftwareUpdatePoint)
    client must be in a workgroup
copy entire contents of source SCCM client folder to ea client computer
open cmd as admin
run cmd setup
  ccmsetup.exe /mp:<ManagementPointFQDN> SMSSITECODE=<ex. 001> SMSMP=<ManagementPointFQDN> DNSSUFFIX=<domainsuffix>
(note: logs are in C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\ClientLocation.log and C:\Windows\CCM\Logs\LocationServices.log)
open SCCM on server and approve ea client

    
-----------------------------------
TODO (revisit upon receiving new licenses):
Set up DNS, this will be split-horizon with the ISP DNS, then disable LLMNR and NBT through regedit GPO's
audit and change Domain Controller GPO for security and silence
install AV
install zonealarm
install tripwire
re-run security configuration wizard
install MBSA and SCCM
