general idea is to set up OSSIM and Splunk on spare machine in homelab.  
ship all logs to OSSIM then to Splunk instance.  
then create an AWS instance honeypot to ship even more logs to Splunk.  
AWS instance must route logs through dedicated firewall at DMZ.  
then pair down Splunk dashboard until it's more or less a good SIEM.

[---syslog---]----extranet-->[OSSIM->[Splunk]]<--intranet----[--syslog---]

OSSIM install guide
don't need a guide

Splunk install
don't need a guide

Splunk integrate with OSSIM
google it, use the plugin



in the real world, here's what I need to do.  
#1 set up firewall my own firewall at demarc edge.  have to decide on what to use for this.  
then...
add that ram module to the laptop.
add eth1 nic to laptop.
cable manage laptop, start up, install OSSIM, set up on controlled subnet.  
figure out what OSSIM needs to catch logs, set it up.
